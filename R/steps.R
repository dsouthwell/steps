#' @description Simulating shifts in species populations is an important
#' part of ecological management. Species respond to spatial and temporal
#' changes in the landscape resulting from environmental phenomena, managerial
#' actions or anthropogenic activities. This data is crucial for modelling,
#' however, current software that incorporates this information has limited
#' flexibility, transparency, and availability. \code{steps} extends the features
#' found in existing software and uses common spatial inputs that are derived
#' from many other software packages.
