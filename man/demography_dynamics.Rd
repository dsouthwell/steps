\arguments{
\item{demography_dynamics_function}{A function that operates on a state object to change demography at specified timesteps. User may enter a custom function or select a pre-defined module - see examples.}

\item{x}{an object to print or test as an demography_dynamic object}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}

\item{state}{a state object to apply the demographic function to}

\item{timestep}{the timestep in the experiment to apply the demographic function to the state object}

\item{global_transition_matrix}{a life-stage transition matrix}

\item{stochasticity}{a matrix with standard deviations (consistent or varying) around the transition means with matching dimensions as the life-stage transition matrix or a number representing a consitent standard deviation to apply to all transitions (default is 0)}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{demography_dynamics}
}
\description{
A 'demography dynamics' object is used to modify life-stage transition matrices - adding stochasticity for example.
It is a sub-component of a \link[steps]{dynamics} object and is executed in each timestep of an experiment.
